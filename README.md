# [OCLP-3.1.7 Tahoe Patch Set by YBronst](https://github.com/YBronst/OCLP-YBronst/releases/edit/3.1.7)
**Based on the lzhoang2801 Tahoe patchset (Dec 24, 2025 state).**

## OCLP-YBronst 3.1.7 - Tahoe Patch Set

### ⚠️ Attention
* **AMFIPass** cannot be used with OCLP 3.1.7 due to a persistent kernel panic. Instead, use the `amfi=0x80` boot argument.

### 📝 Change log

* **Compatibility:** Full support for **macOS Tahoe 26.0 (25A5316i)** through **macOS 26.4 (25E5233c)**, with potential support for subsequent 26.x builds.
* **HFS+ Removal Adaptation:** Apple removed the HFS+ file system in macOS 26.4. This version adapts the patching logic to remain compatible with the now APFS-only system environment.
* **hdiutil Permissions:** Fixed an issue where macOS 26.4 disallowed mounting via `hdiutil` without root privileges.
* **Modern Audio Toggle:** Added a toggle to the **Root Patches** menu to enable/disable the 'Modern Audio' patch (AppleHDA restoration). This provides manual control and prevents panics if a matching KDK is not yet installed for future builds.
* **KDK Support:** A new button in the Help menu allows downloading the latest Kernel Debug Kit.

For systems requiring a fully functional reference environment (including sound) on macOS 26.3 and earlier, I recommend a saved and working patch snapshot from December 24th, available here: [`OCLP-lzhoang2801`](https://github.com/kgp-macPro/OCLP-lzhoang2801)

*Note: This patch set still requires the `amfi=0x80` boot argument.*
